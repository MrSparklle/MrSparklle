### üèÖ Qualifications

‚Ä¢ In last 7 years I had specialized as frontend engineer through the use of frameworks aimed at web projects and mobile devices using technologies such as Angular, React (Next.js), Ionic, React Native and Node.js (Nest.js and Express). During my career I acquired solid knowledge in projects using frontend technologies such as HTML5, CSS, SASS, Typescript, Javascript, generation of static content using Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG).

‚Ä¢ Experience collaborating in a quality-focused environment where testing and code reviewing is a part of the everyday process. I always prioritize writing clean, well-documented code following SOLID principles.

‚Ä¢ Strong experience with semantic HTML and familiarity with web accessibility best practices. Familiar with various approaches to styling - from plain CSS to CSS-in-JS, and methodologies for organizing CSS. Also feel comfortable using design tools such as Illustrator, Sketch, or Figma.

‚Ä¢ Expert in systems documentation for scope closure (use cases), customer communication at all business levels for survey and requirements specification documents, as well as the use of software estimation and measurement metrics (FPA / NESMA) to calculate project costs and effort.

‚Ä¢ Experience in planning and developing systems designed using case tools, with technical references in systems analysis using UML models, use cases, backlog management, requirements specification and practical testing approaches (TDD, ATDD) using Jest or Jasmine among others unit testing software‚Äôs.

‚Ä¢ Solid experience in IT projects using agile methodologies (Scrum / Kanban / Feature-Driven Development) through participation in several projects. Focus on delivery on time with agreed cost and quality. Risk management within the agreed KPIs and establishment of efficient engagement channels within the team.

‚Ä¢ Specialist in data development and modeling in SQL languages aimed at relational databases (Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL/Aurora). Database prototyping and modeling for systems using tools such as Enterprise Architect, Powerdesigner, routines development, packages, procedures, triggers in SQL language.
